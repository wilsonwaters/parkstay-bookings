// Types for the main ↔ renderer API.

/**
 * Why an IPC call failed. Set on every `success: false` response from `ipc/handle.ts`.
 * - VALIDATION: the request payload failed its contract schema (or a service rule); `issues` lists the paths.
 * - FORBIDDEN: the sender is not the app's own top-level renderer frame.
 * - NO_PROFILE: there is no local profile row to act for.
 * - NOT_FOUND: the record the request names does not exist.
 * - INTERNAL: anything else; `error` carries the thrown message.
 *
 * Provider errors (`main/providers/sdk/errors.ts` `toApiError`):
 * - CAPABILITY: the provider does not offer what the request needs (e.g. holds).
 * - UNKNOWN_PROVIDER: no provider is registered with that id.
 * - PROVIDER_ERROR: the provider failed (HTTP error, timeout, unreadable response).
 * - ACCESS_GATE: the provider's waiting room or queue is in the way.
 * - AUTH_REQUIRED: sign in to the provider first.
 * - NOT_IMPLEMENTED: the method is in the contract but its service has not landed yet
 *   (`catalog` and `accounts` until their services are built).
