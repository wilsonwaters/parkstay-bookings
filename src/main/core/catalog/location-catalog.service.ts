/**
 * `LocationCatalogService`: one fast, offline-capable catalogue of every location from every
 * provider (architecture-notes §1, §4, §5), behind the `catalog.*` IPC namespace.
 *
 * - **Sync.** Each provider with `capabilities.catalog` and `catalogMode: 'full'` has its
 *   `catalog.listLocations` copied into `locations` (one transaction), at most once per
 *   `limits.catalogTtlHours` (24 h) unless forced. Syncs are single-flight per provider and
 *   run in parallel, so one provider's failure never blocks another's; a failed or empty
 *   sync keeps the cached rows and records `lastError`. The outcome is kept in
 *   `provider_state` as `('<providerId>', 'core.catalog.sync')` and announced as
 *   `catalog:updated`.
 * - **Search** runs on the cache (FTS5, filters, facets): `LocationRepository.search`.
 * - **Detail** is cached for 6 h; when the provider fails, the cached copy (or the summary)
 *   comes back marked `stale`.
 * - **Availability** fans out to every `bulkAvailability` provider (5 min cache) and reports
 *   each provider's failure separately. It never waits in a provider's queue: a gated
 *   provider answers with an `access-gate` error entry at once, and that error (or a
 *   `timeout`) is reused for 60 s per stay, so map pans during a queue ask nothing.
 * - **Automatic sync** (`start`) begins 5 s after the window is up and re-checks hourly,
 *   only for stale providers, and never while one of the provider's snipes is queueing or
 *   sniping (a 1.2 MB fetch must not compete with a release). While a provider has no cached
 *   locations at all (a first launch offline), a failed automatic sync is retried after
 *   1, 2 and 5 minutes before the hourly schedule takes over. Manual refresh always runs.
 * - **Freshness.** A timestamp in the future (the clock was set back) counts as stale.
 *
 * - **Search-mode catalogues** (`catalogMode: 'search'`, §12.30) cannot list every location,
 *   so they are never synced. A `search` with a map area (`bbox`) asks each of them in scope
 *   for that area (`catalog.searchArea`), and one with text asks those that have
 *   `catalog.searchText`; the answer comes from the stored catalogue at once, with those
 *   providers in `pending`. What a search finds is added to `locations` (`mergeMany`), so FTS
 *   search, filters, facets, the detail cache, availability and watches treat it as a synced
 *   place, and `catalog:updated` announces places not stored before. Bounded and polite:
 *   - the area is the box snapped outwards to a grid (`catalogSearchArea`), so small pans
 *     reuse a search, and an area inside one already searched in full is not asked again;
 *   - one search per area or text at a time (single flight), not repeated for the provider's
 *     `catalogTtlHours` (24 h by default; kept for this launch), and after a failure not
 *     for `searchErrorTtlMs` (60 s); an area inside one being searched waits for that search;
 *   - an area search follows `nextCursor` for at most `AREA_SEARCH_MAX_PAGES` (5) pages, and
 *     a text search stores at most `TEXT_SEARCH_MAX_ITEMS` (100) places;
 *   - an area the map has left is not finished: before each page after the first, a search
 *     that is no longer one of the provider's `AREA_SEARCHES_KEPT` (2) newest stops, keeps
 *     what it found, and is not repeated for `searchErrorTtlMs`; a page that fails after the
 *     first keeps the pages before it too;
 *   - at most `maxConcurrentRequests` of the provider's search calls run at once, each with a
 *     `searchTimeoutMs` (20 s) deadline, and `stop()` aborts them all.
 *
 *   Places found by a search are never removed: nothing lists the whole catalogue to tell
 *   what disappeared, and watches, snipes, bookings and links refer to them. A search that
 *   finds a place again refreshes its row; a place the provider no longer has keeps its row,
 *   and its page falls back to the stored copy marked `stale`. The last search and its error
 *   are kept in `provider_state` as `('<providerId>', 'core.catalog.search')`; `refresh()`
 *   forgets which areas and texts were searched, so the next search asks again.
