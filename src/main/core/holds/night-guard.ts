/**
 * One booking per night (DBCA terms; architecture-notes §12.4, §12.31): before a snipe or an
 * auto-hold watch asks a provider for a hold, it reserves the stay's nights here.
 *
 * A reservation conflicts with any of these that shares a night with the stay, for the same
 * provider and user (the owner itself excepted):
 * - a BOOKED snipe, or a HELD snipe whose hold has not expired;
 * - a watch whose auto-hold placed a hold (`last_result 'held'`);
 * - a hold still in flight (reserved here, not answered yet).
 *
 * `tryReserve` is synchronous, so in the single-threaded main process the check and the
 * reservation are one step: two holds for the same nights cannot both pass. The caller
 * releases the reservation once the provider has answered; a placed hold is in the database
 * by then and keeps blocking from there. A conflict with a hold still in flight is reported
 * as transient: that hold may fail, so the other caller tries again later.
