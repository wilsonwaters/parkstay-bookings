/**
 * The quit hold (V7). When the app quits, the providers' browsers get a bounded time to
 * close, so a browser profile is flushed rather than killed with the app.
 *
 * The first `before-quit`:
 * 1. hides every window, so nobody keeps using an app that is shutting down;
 * 2. runs `shutDown`, which cuts the renderer off and closes the database before it returns
 *    (`AppContainer.dispose`), and resolves once every browser has closed;
 * 3. holds the quit (`preventDefault`) until that resolves or `graceMs` passes, whichever
 *    is first, and then quits again.
 *
 * A `before-quit` during the hold is held too. The quit the hold sends at the end goes
 * through.
