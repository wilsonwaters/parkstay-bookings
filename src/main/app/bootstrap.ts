/**
 * The Electron shell's first steps, in the order they must run, all before `ready`:
 *
 * 1. `configureAppPaths`: userData becomes `<appData>/WA Stay`, then (from source only) the
 *    test-only override `WA_STAY_USER_DATA_DIR` (§12.14). Everything after this reads it:
 *    the single-instance lock, the log files, the vault (§12.23).
 * 2. `app.setAppUserModelId` (Windows): the packaged app uses its appId, so taskbar
 *    grouping, toasts and the launch-at-login entry name agree with the installer's
 *    shortcuts. From source it is `process.execPath` (the Electron binary), so a dev run
 *    never shares an identity with the installed app.
 * 3. The single-instance lock, which lives in userData.
 *
 * After `ready`, `index.ts` runs the legacy install migration, then opens the database.
