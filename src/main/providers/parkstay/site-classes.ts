/**
 * Campgrounds ParkStay lists by site class rather than by site (`site_type` 1 or 2). Lucky
 * Bay (Cape Le Grand, 43) is one: its 56 sites form one class, "One site - select on
 * arrival". For these, `campsite_availablity_view` has one entry per class
 * (`api.py:1375-1527`; checked live on 9 Oct 2026):
 *
 * - `type` is the class id and `name` its name. `id` is one site of the class: the first by
 *   name, or, while some site is free for the whole stay, any one of those (`v.pop()`,
 *   `api.py:1521`), so it changes from poll to poll. `classes` is empty.
 * - `availability` has one tuple per night, `[bookable, label, price, _, counts, date]`.
 *   While some site is free for the whole stay, every night is bookable
 *   (`api.py:1503-1524`). Otherwise a night is bookable only when no site of the class is
 *   taken; its label is the price while some site is free, `Booked` when every site is booked
 *   and `Unavailable` when every site is closed or not released (`api.py:1438-1497`).
 *   `counts` is `[booked, closed, other]` sites.
 * - `breakdown`, only when no site is free for the whole stay, lists each site of the class
 *   by name with its nights, `[free, label, price, _]` (`api.py:1429-1431,1500-1501`).
 *
 * A class is booked as a class: `create_booking` refuses a site at such a campground
 * ("Campground doesn't support per-site bookings.", `api.py:3112-3123`) and, given
 * `campsite_class`, holds the first site of the class that is free for the whole stay, or
 * answers "Campsite class unavailable for specified time period." (`utils.py:186-202`).
 *
 * So the module shows each class as one unit, `class:<class id>`, whatever site `id` the view
 * gave, and a hold for it posts `campsite_class`: ParkStay picks the free site. Unit ids kept
 * from before #21 are site ids; they name a class through `classesOfSiteId`, from the view.
