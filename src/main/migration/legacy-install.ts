/**
 * First-run migration of a v1.x install to WA Stay (architecture-notes §6, §12.12, §12.23).
 *
 * v1.x kept its data in `<appData>/<LEGACY_DATA_FOLDER_NAME>`; WA Stay keeps it in
 * `<appData>/WA Stay` (`app/paths.ts`). On the first start after the upgrade, before the
 * database is opened and before the vault's first use, this copies:
 *
 * - the v1.x database to `wa-stay.db` with SQLite's online backup, from a read-only
 *   connection. That gives a consistent copy even while a v1.x app is still running, and
 *   includes any transactions still in the `-wal` file. The copy then goes through the
 *   normal migrations (`openDatabase`), and P5's `migrateLegacySecrets` re-encrypts its
 *   legacy secrets.
 *
 * The v1.x Gmail OTP sign-in (`gmail-oauth.json`) is not copied: the feature is gone (P7),
 * and nothing would read it.
 *
 * The source is the live legacy folder when it exists, else the v2 installer's
 * `legacy-snapshot` (taken before the v1 uninstaller could delete the folder), else there
 * is nothing to migrate.
 *
 * **The legacy folder and the snapshot are never deleted or modified.** They are the only
 * backup of the user's data as v1.x left it, including the pre-vault secrets that
 * `migrateLegacySecrets` re-encrypts in the copy. (Opening the source read-only may leave
 * SQLite's empty `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars next to it; the database file is never written.)
 *
 * `migration.json` in the data folder records what happened:
 *
 * | status | meaning | next start |
 * | --- | --- | --- |
 * | `in-progress` | a copy started and did not finish (crash or kill) | sets aside any `wa-stay.db`, then copies again |
 * | `complete` | copied | the follow-ups still `pending`, if any |
 * | `failed` | the copy failed and the user chose Quit | tries again |
 * | `declined` | the copy failed and the user chose "Start fresh" | nothing |
 * | `skipped` | `wa-stay.db` already existed, so nothing was copied over it | nothing |
 *
 * A fresh install writes no marker, so a snapshot the installer takes later is still used.
 * The copy is written to `wa-stay.db.migrating`, checked, then renamed into place, so
 * `wa-stay.db` is either absent or complete. Logs carry paths, sizes, schema versions and
 * error codes, never row data or secrets.
 *
 * **A database in the data folder is never deleted.** A start that goes on to open
 * `wa-stay.db` without a finished copy (`fresh-install`, `declined`) first replaces or
 * removes a non-final marker, so a later start never takes the user's database for an
 * unfinished copy. If that fails too, the redo moves whatever is at `wa-stay.db` aside to
 * `wa-stay.db.before-legacy-<time>` instead of deleting it.
 *
 * The follow-ups of a copy (the welcome notice and launch at login under WA Stay,
 * `finishLegacyInstall`) are `pending` in the `complete` marker until each succeeds, so a
 * start that crashes after the copy leaves them to the next one.
