# WA Stay test suite

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Build better-sqlite3 for Node (npm ci builds it for Electron; see "Native module ABI guard")
npm rebuild better-sqlite3

# Run all Jest tests (both projects)
npm test

# Run one project
npx jest --selectProjects main
npx jest --selectProjects renderer

# Run specific test file (only the project that owns it runs)
npm test -- tests/unit/core/watch.service.test.ts

# Run with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run the Electron smoke tests (Playwright; built app, needs the Electron ABI; see "Electron smoke tests")
npm run build:e2e && npm run test:e2e

# Run live Electron tests (real Chromium networking; not part of npm test)
npm run test:electron
```

## Jest projects

`jest.config.js` defines two [projects](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#projects-arraystring--projectconfig) built from one shared base (roots, transform, module aliases). Jest projects do not inherit root options, so anything both need goes in that base.

| Project | `testEnvironment` | Test files | Setup file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | `node` | `tests/unit/**`, `tests/integration/**`, `tests/scripts/**`, `src/main/**`, `src/shared/**` | `tests/setup/main.ts` (`setupFiles`) |
| `renderer` | `jsdom` | `src/renderer/**`, `tests/renderer/**` | `tests/setup/renderer.ts` (`setupFilesAfterEnv`) |

- Test files are named `*.test.ts` / `*.test.tsx`.
- `npm test -- <path>` runs only the project whose files match the path.
- Coverage (`collectCoverageFrom`, `coverageThreshold`, `coverageReporters`) is configured once at the root. It is aggregated across both projects and the threshold (branches 9, functions 17, lines 16, statements 16) is evaluated once, globally.

### Writing tests for the `main` project

- **There is no DOM.** `window`, `document` and other jsdom globals do not exist. A main-process or shared test that needs them is relying on something it should not; fix the test rather than moving it to `renderer`.
- **`electron` is not mocked.** Outside Electron, `require('electron')` returns the path to the Electron binary (a string), not the API, so `app`, `BrowserWindow`, `Notification` and friends are `undefined`. A test that needs Electron APIs mocks the module itself:

  ```typescript
  jest.mock('electron', () => ({
    app: { getPath: jest.fn(() => '/tmp/wa-stay-test'), isReady: jest.fn(() => true) },
  }));
  ```

  There is deliberately no global `jest.mock('electron')`: it would hide accidental Electron coupling in code that is meant to be pure.

## Setup files

- **`tests/setup/main.ts`** (`setupFiles`, runs before any module loads) sets `process.env.LOG_LEVEL ??= 'warn'`, so the Winston logger skips info/debug output but still prints warnings and errors. An explicit level wins: `LOG_LEVEL=debug npm test`.
- **`tests/setup/renderer.ts`** (`setupFilesAfterEnv`) loads the `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers and installs a mock `window.api` (see below).

Neither file silences the console. A test that expects an error to be logged spies on the console locally and restores it:

```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {});
});

afterEach(() => {
  jest.restoreAllMocks();
});
```

## Mocking `window.api` (renderer)

The renderer setup installs `createMockWindowApi()` from `tests/utils/window-api.ts` on `window.api`: once when the test file loads and again, fresh, before every test. It is a `Proxy` typed as `Window['api']`, so it needs no list of namespaces and keeps working when the preload API changes shape.

Every member, at any depth, is a `jest.fn()` that rejects with `window.api.<namespace>.<method> is not mocked in this test` until the test stubs it:

```typescript
jest.mocked(window.api.watches.list).mockResolvedValue({ success: true, data: [] });
// or
window.api.settings.get = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ success: true, data: null });

expect(window.api.watches.list).toHaveBeenCalledWith();
```

- Stub in the test or in a `beforeEach`. Stubs made at module scope or in `beforeAll` are replaced before each test.
- `jest.resetAllMocks()` / `mockReset()` clear the default rejection (the method then returns `undefined`); prefer `jest.clearAllMocks()`.
- An un-stubbed call that nobody awaits becomes an unhandled rejection, and Node 22 crashes the Jest process for that file. In-band the run exits 1 with only Node's stack; with workers it is reported as "Jest worker encountered child process exceptions". stderr still names the method. Always `await` (or stub) every `window.api` call a component makes.

## Clocks and dates

Tests must not depend on the real date or the machine's time zone.

- Pin the clock with `jest.useFakeTimers({ now: new Date('2026-06-15T12:00:00.000Z') })`. Every file that calls `jest.useFakeTimers` also calls `jest.useRealTimers()` in an `afterEach` (or `afterAll`), so a failing test cannot leak fake timers.
- Use mid-day UTC for fixed dates, so the local calendar day is the same from UTC−11 to UTC+11. Build every date in a test from the same pinned instant, so UTC+14 passes too.
- SQLite's `date('now')` (used by `BookingRepository.findUpcoming` / `findPast`) ignores Jest fake timers. Use fixed dates far in the future or past instead.
- Fixtures do not read the clock either: `tests/fixtures/watches.ts` builds dates from a fixed reference date.

Check the main project in several time zones:

```bash
TZ=UTC npx jest --selectProjects main
TZ=Australia/Perth npx jest --selectProjects main
TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati npx jest --selectProjects main   # UTC+14
```

## Native module ABI guard

`better-sqlite3` is a native module and must be compiled for the runtime that loads it. `npm install` / `npm ci` run the `postinstall` script (`electron-builder install-app-deps`), which compiles it for **Electron** (NODE_MODULE_VERSION 119). Jest runs on plain **Node** (115 on Node 20, 127 on Node 22) and needs the Node build.

`scripts/check-native-abi.js` runs as `pretest`, `pretest:coverage` and `pretest:watch`. It loads `better-sqlite3`, opens a `:memory:` database and exits silently if that works (it adds well under a second). Otherwise it stops the run with one message instead of a `dlopen` error in every database test:

- **ABI mismatch:** prints both NODE_MODULE_VERSION numbers, explains that Electron's build is installed, and gives the fix, `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.
- **Not installed** (missing package, or `npm ci --ignore-scripts` left no binary): prints an install hint.
- **Any other load error** (for example a missing libc symbol): prints the original error unchanged.

Set `AUTO_REBUILD_NATIVE=1` to have the guard run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` itself on a mismatch, re-check, and continue:

```bash
AUTO_REBUILD_NATIVE=1 npm test
```

To run the Electron app again afterwards, rebuild for Electron with `npm run rebuild`. Calling `npx jest` directly skips the guard. The diagnosis logic lives in `scripts/lib/native-abi.js` and is unit tested in `tests/scripts/native-abi.test.ts`.

Renderer component tests are co-located with the components (`src/renderer/**/*.test.tsx`). `tests/renderer/` is also part of the renderer project, for renderer tests that do not belong next to one component.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
Tests individual services in isolation with mocked dependencies.

**Example** (the core services run on a real in-memory database and a FakeProvider, through
`tests/utils/core-harness.ts`):
```typescript
describe('watch auto-hold', () => {
  let h: CoreHarness;

  beforeEach(() => {
    h = createCoreHarness({ providers: [createFakeProvider()] });
  });

  afterEach(() => h.close());

  it('persists the hold it placed', async () => {
    const watch = await h.watches.create(h.userId, h.watchInput({ autoHold: true }));
    await h.watches.execute(watch.id);
    expect(h.watchRepo.findById(watch.id)?.hold).toMatchObject({ reference: 'FAKE-1' });
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
Tests multiple components working together, including database operations. IPC tests build
the real container and call handlers through `tests/utils/ipc-harness.ts`, with `electron`
mocked (`tests/utils/electron-mocks.ts`).

**Example:**
```typescript
it('a lapsed hold cannot be paid for', async () => {
  const snipe = heldSnipe('2072968', new Date(Date.now() - 60_000));
  await expect(call('snipes:open-payment', { id: snipe.id })).resolves.toMatchObject({
    success: false,
    code: 'HOLD_EXPIRED',
  });
});
```

### Electron smoke tests (`tests/e2e/`)
Journeys through the built app (main, preload and renderer together), driven by Playwright's
`_electron` launcher. See [Electron smoke tests](#electron-smoke-tests-e2e) below.

### Live Electron Tests (`tests/electron/`)
Some behaviour only exists in Electron's real network stack, so mocks cannot prove it: the
production `ElectronSessionHttpClient` sends requests through Chromium on a session
partition (redirect handling, session cookies on every hop, Referer policy, `net::ERR_*`
failures). These tests run inside Electron, not Jest:

```bash
npm run test:electron                  # every tests/electron/*.electron.ts
npm run test:electron -- http-transport
```

- `tests/electron/run.js` bundles each `*.electron.ts` with esbuild (`electron` stays
  external) and launches it as Electron's main script with `--no-sandbox`. The test prints
  TAP and exits non-zero on any failure.
- **Linux needs a display:** without `DISPLAY` the runner wraps Electron in `xvfb-run -a`
  (`apt-get install xvfb`). Windows and macOS need nothing extra.
- Everything is local: the HTTP transport test starts two loopback servers on 127.0.0.1 (two
  origins) and uses a throwaway `userData` folder, so no network or proxy is needed.
- `http-transport.electron.ts` runs the same cases as
  `tests/unit/providers/http-transport-parity.test.ts`, which Jest runs against
  `NodeHttpClient` (from `tests/utils/http-transport-cases.ts`), plus Electron-only checks.
  A behaviour change in either client must keep both runs green.
- Not part of `npm test`: it needs the Electron binary and a display. Run it when you change
  `src/main/providers/sdk/http*.ts`.

## Electron smoke tests (E2E)

`tests/e2e/` holds the Electron smoke suite: a handful of journeys through the **built** app
(main, preload and renderer together), driven by Playwright's `_electron` launcher. It
catches what Jest cannot: startup crashes, preload or sandbox breakage, CSP violations,
broken routing and focus, and a quit that hangs.

```bash
npm run build:e2e                 # the normal build, with no Mapbox token (scripts/build-e2e.js)
xvfb-run -a npm run test:e2e      # Linux without a display; elsewhere: npm run test:e2e
npx playwright show-report        # the HTML report of the last run
```

- **Build first.** The tests launch `dist/`, never the dev server. `build:e2e` runs `npm run
  build` with `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` set to an empty string, so a token in your `.env` never
  reaches the e2e build and Explore is deterministically list-only. The suite stops at once
  with "run `npm run build:e2e` first" when `dist/` is missing.
- **Native ABI.** The app needs better-sqlite3 built for Electron, Jest needs it built for Node
  (see [Native module ABI guard](#native-module-abi-guard)). After `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`
  for Jest, run `npm run rebuild` before the suite. With the Node build the launch fails with
  "WA Stay did not start" and the main process's `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` error.
- **Display.** Electron needs one: on Linux without a desktop use `xvfb-run -a`. Windows and
  macOS need nothing extra.
- **Linux sandbox.** On CI (`CI` set) the harness passes `--no-sandbox`, because Ubuntu 24.04
  runners restrict the user namespaces Electron's sandbox needs. Playwright adds it itself when
  running as root. If Electron aborts with a sandbox error on your machine, run with `CI=1`.
- **One app at a time.** `workers: 1`, no parallelism; each test launches its own app, so the
  suite takes about a minute. On CI a failed test is retried once.

### What every launch gets (`support/wa-stay.ts`)

The `launchWaStay()` fixture starts the app with:

- **Its own userData**, a fresh temp folder (`WA_STAY_USER_DATA_DIR`). Before anything else it
  checks that the app really uses it (`app.getPath('userData')`), so a test can never touch a
  real profile. Pass `{ userDataDir }` to relaunch on an existing one, and `{ prepare }` to seed
  the profile before the app starts (see "Seeding data" below).
- **Fixture mode** (`WA_STAY_E2E_FIXTURES_DIR=tests/e2e/fixtures/http`): every provider's
  `HttpClient` is a `FixtureHttpClient` that answers from recorded responses, and a network
  guard cancels every other http(s)/ws(s) request any Electron session makes. Each refusal is
  written to `<userData>/e2e-unexpected-requests.log`; the lifecycle spec requires it to be
  empty. `WA_STAY_E2E_ALLOW_HOSTS` (comma-separated hosts, subdomains included) lets some
  through, for documentation screenshots.
- **A production renderer**: `NODE_ENV=production`, no `ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL`, no Mapbox
  token, `TZ=Australia/Perth`, `LANG=en_AU.UTF-8`.
- **An online window, whatever the host.** Chromium reads `navigator.onLine` from the host's
  network interfaces, so a machine with loopback only (a sandbox, `unshare -n`) looks offline
  and Explore turns its availability off. The harness overrides it through DevTools network
  emulation (`forceOnline`), so the suite passes with no network at all.

These test-only hooks live in `src/main/testing/` and are honoured only when the app runs from
source: unpackaged, and not loaded from an asar archive (`src/main/app/app-source.ts`), so a
packaged executable renamed to `electron` (which Electron then reports as unpackaged) ignores
them too (architecture-notes §12.14). Unit tests in `tests/unit/testing/` and
`tests/unit/app/` prove it, and CI's packaged smoke check (below) runs the real package both
ways.

The fixture returns `{ app, window, userDataDir, consoleErrors(), mainLog(),
unexpectedRequests(), close() }`. After the test it closes every app it started (killing one
that hangs), then deletes the temp folders. A test that needs a folder of its own (a v1.x data
folder) takes the `tempDir` fixture: `tempDir('legacy')` makes one, removed after the apps
have closed. When a test fails, the report gets the Electron window's trace (`trace-N`) and
screenshot, the main process's output and log file, the renderer console errors and the
unexpected requests.

### Seeding data

`support/seed.ts` writes data before a launch with the app's own built code
(`support/seed-db.js`, run with the Electron binary as Node, `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, so
better-sqlite3's Electron build loads and `dist/main` opens and migrates the database):

- `seedHeldSnipe(userDataDir, …)`, from `launchWaStay({ prepare })`: a HELD snipe with its hold
  and its `snipe_held` notification. No hold is ever placed (architecture-notes §12.33).
- `writeLegacyV1Data(dir)`: a v1.2.0 data folder from `tests/fixtures/db/v5-release-1.2.0.sql`,
  for `WA_STAY_LEGACY_DATA_DIR` (the upgrade journey).

Data a page can create through the preload is written that way instead
(`window.api.bookings.create`, `window.api.watches.create`), from the test.

### Fixtures

Recorded provider responses live in `tests/e2e/fixtures/http/<providerId>/`, with a
`manifest.json` of routes. The format, where the data comes from and how to refresh it are in
[`fixtures/http/README.md`](e2e/fixtures/http/README.md).

### Adding a journey

1. Create `tests/e2e/<journey>.spec.ts`. Import `test` and `expect` from `./support/wa-stay`
   and the shell helpers (`navLink`, `pageHeading`, `chooseAccountMenuItem`, …) from
   `./support/shell`.
2. Start with `const { window } = await launchWaStay();`. Isolation, fixture mode and the
   report attachments come with it. Seed what the journey needs (see "Seeding data").
3. Find elements only by role, label or text (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`), using the
   accessible names in `docs/design/shell.md` and the feature's spec. No CSS classes, XPath or
   test ids: `grep -rnE "locator\(['\"][.#\[]|xpath=|data-testid" tests/e2e` must print nothing.
4. Use web-first assertions (`toBeVisible`, `toHaveCount`, `toBeFocused`, `expect.poll`), never
   `waitForTimeout`. After a page change, assert where focus is (`expectHeadingFocused`).
5. If the journey makes provider requests, run it once: each request with no fixture fails with
   "no fixture for GET …; add a route to …/manifest.json", and the failed test's
   `unexpected-requests` attachment lists them. Add the routes and response files.
6. Add the journey's pages to the lifecycle spec's journey, so its console errors and requests
   are checked too.

To mark a known gap an assertion is waiting for, use `test.fail(condition, reason)` with a
condition that turns false once the gap is closed; then remove the line. The suite has none.

### Debugging

- `npm run test:e2e:debug` (or `PWDEBUG=1 npm run test:e2e`) opens the Playwright Inspector and
  pauses at each step. It needs a real display: run it outside `xvfb-run`.
- `--headed` changes nothing here: Electron windows are always shown. Under `xvfb-run` they are
  on the virtual display; run without it on a desktop to watch.
- `npx playwright show-trace test-results/<test>/trace-1.zip` replays a failed launch: DOM
  snapshots, screenshots, console and network.
- `npx playwright test navigation -g "keyboard"` runs one spec or test.
- With no network at all: run the suite in a network namespace whose only interface is
  loopback, brought up first because Playwright talks to Electron over 127.0.0.1, e.g.
  `unshare -rn sh -c 'ip link set lo up && xvfb-run -a npm run test:e2e'`. It must pass.

### CI

The `e2e` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on `ubuntu-latest` (20 minutes at most):
`npm ci` (whose postinstall builds better-sqlite3 for Electron, so the job does not rebuild it
for Node), `npm run build:e2e`, then `xvfb-run -a npm run test:e2e`. It always uploads
`playwright-report/` and `test-results/` (7 days), so a test that failed and passed on its
retry leaves its first attempt's trace and logs. It is not in `build.yml`, so it never blocks a
release tag.

The `packaged-smoke` job checks what electron-builder ships: `npm run build:e2e`,
`npx electron-builder --linux dir --publish never`, then `xvfb-run -a npm run smoke:packaged`
(`scripts/packaged-smoke.js`). It starts `release/linux-unpacked/wa-stay` with a temp
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and every test-only hook set, waits for the window's `h1`, and requires that
userData is the temp `WA Stay` folder, the page comes from `app.asar`, and `app.quit()` exits
with code 0 within 10 s. It then does the same with a copy of the executable named `electron`,
which Electron reports as unpackaged.

## Test Utilities

### TestDatabaseHelper
Manages test database lifecycle.

```typescript
import { TestDatabaseHelper } from '@tests/utils/database-helper';

const dbHelper = new TestDatabaseHelper('my-test');
await dbHelper.setup();            // Create & initialize test DB
const db = dbHelper.getDb();       // Get database instance
await dbHelper.reset();            // Clear all data
await dbHelper.teardown();         // Delete test DB
```

### Test Helpers
Common utilities for tests.

```typescript
import { waitFor, sleep, randomEmail } from '@tests/utils/test-helpers';

// Wait for condition
await waitFor(() => element.isVisible(), 5000);

// Generate random data
const email = randomEmail();
const date = randomFutureDate();

// Handle async errors
await expectAsyncThrow(
  () => service.doSomething(),
  'Expected error message'
);
```

## Test Fixtures

### Using Fixtures
```typescript
import { mockUserInput, createMockUser } from '@tests/fixtures/users';
import { mockBooking, createMockBooking } from '@tests/fixtures/bookings';

// Use predefined fixture
const user = mockUserInput;

// Create custom fixture
const customUser = createMockUser({ email: 'custom@example.com' });

// Create multiple fixtures
const bookings = createMultipleMockBookings(10, userId);
```

## Writing Tests

### Test Structure
Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert):

```typescript
it('should do something', async () => {
  // Arrange: Set up test data and environment
  const input = createMockBookingInput();

  // Act: Execute the code being tested
  const result = await bookingService.createBooking(userId, input);

  // Assert: Verify the results
  expect(result).toBeDefined();
  expect(result.bookingReference).toBe(input.bookingReference);
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Isolated Tests**: Each test should be independent
2. **Clear Names**: Test names should describe what they test
3. **Single Responsibility**: One test should test one thing
4. **Cleanup**: Always clean up resources (databases, files, etc.)
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Don't make real API calls
6. **Test Edge Cases**: Test both success and failure scenarios
7. **Use Fixtures**: Reuse test data through fixtures
8. **Async/Await**: Properly handle async operations

### Example Test

```typescript
describe('BookingService', () => {
  describe('createBooking', () => {
    it('should create a valid booking', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = createMockBookingInput();

      // Act
      const booking = await bookingService.createBooking(userId, input);

      // Assert
      expect(booking.id).toBeDefined();
      expect(booking.userId).toBe(userId);
      expect(booking.status).toBe(BookingStatus.CONFIRMED);
    });

    it('should reject invalid dates', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const input = createMockBookingInput({
        arrivalDate: new Date('2024-06-05'),
        departureDate: new Date('2024-06-01'), // Before arrival!
      });

      // Act & Assert
      await expectAsyncThrow(
        () => bookingService.createBooking(userId, input),
        'Departure date must be after arrival date'
      );
    });
  });
});
```

## Debugging Tests

### Run Single Test
```bash
npm test -- tests/unit/core/watch.service.test.ts
```

### Run Tests Matching Pattern
```bash
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should encrypt"
```

### Debug in VS Code
Add to `.vscode/launch.json`:
```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Jest Debug",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/.bin/jest",
  "args": ["--runInBand", "--no-cache"],
  "console": "integratedTerminal",
  "internalConsoleOptions": "neverOpen"
}
```

### View Coverage
```bash
npm run test:coverage
open coverage/index.html
```

## CI/CD Integration

The workflows are `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (lint and format, type-check, Jest with coverage
on Ubuntu, Windows and macOS plus `npm run test:tz`, a build check, the Electron smoke tests and
the packaged smoke check) and `.github/workflows/build.yml` (the release build, which runs the
Jest suite and `test:tz` first). The Jest jobs run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` after `npm ci`.

The Electron smoke tests need the Electron build of better-sqlite3, so they run in their own
job (see [Electron smoke tests → CI](#ci)).

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" errors
```bash
# Clear Jest cache
npx jest --clearCache

# Rebuild native modules
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

### Database errors
```bash
# Clean up test databases
rm -rf tests/.test-dbs

# Rebuild SQLite
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

### E2E tests not starting
- "run `npm run build:e2e` first": the suite drives the built app; build it.
- "WA Stay did not start" with `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` in the log: better-sqlite3 is built for
  Node (for Jest). Run `npm run rebuild` (the Electron build), then the suite again.
- "Unable to open X display" on Linux: run it under `xvfb-run -a`.

### TypeScript errors
```bash
# Check TypeScript configuration
npm run type-check

# Update path mappings in jest.config.js
```

## Coverage Thresholds

`jest.config.js` enforces a global floor across both projects: branches 9%, functions 17%, lines 16%, statements 16%. Do not lower it to make a run pass.

## Contributing

When adding new features:
1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Maintain coverage above thresholds
4. Add fixtures for new entities
5. Update this documentation
