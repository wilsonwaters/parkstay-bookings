# Streams — WA Stay

Status key: ⬜ not started · 🟦 in progress · ✅ done

| Stream | Label | Outcome | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Platform | `stream:platform` | The main process is well-layered, secure and testable: one repository pattern, transactional migrations, typed and validated IPC, hardened windows, OS-backed secrets, a sandboxed preload, no dead code. | L | ⬜ |
| Providers | `stream:providers` | Accommodation providers are plug-in modules behind one SDK. ParkStay is the first module. Core services (watch, snipe, booking, catalogue, accounts) are provider-agnostic. A browser-automation runtime exists for providers with no API. | L | ⬜ |
| Brand & migration | `stream:brand-migration` | The app is WA Stay everywhere (assets, installer, emails). Existing installs upgrade in place with all data carried over. | M | ⬜ |
| Design system | `stream:design-system` | A documented WA Stay design language, a tokenised Tailwind theme, an accessible component library, and a new top-nav app shell with no login gate. | L | ⬜ |
| Explore | `stream:explore` | Users discover accommodation on a Mapbox map plus search, open a rich location detail view, and see date-aware availability. | L | ⬜ |
| Provider-first UX | `stream:provider-ux` | Watches, Site Sniper, Bookings, Settings/Accounts and notifications are rebuilt on the design system. They are provider-first, and every item shows its provider. | L | ⬜ |
| Docs & quality | `stream:docs` | Electron smoke E2E. The README, docs, developer guide (adding a provider), CLAUDE.md and CHANGELOG describe WA Stay. | M | ⬜ |

## Execution lanes

All work lands on `ccr-da6e94c0-litpr7`. Lanes run in parallel git worktrees and are merged into the feature branch after review.

- **Lane M (main process):** P1 → P2 → P3 → {P4, P5, P6} → V1 → {V2, V3, V7} → V4 → V5 → V6 → B2 → B3 → P7
- **Lane R (renderer):** D1 → D2 → D3 → E1 → E2 → E3 → U1 → U3 → U2 → U4 → U5
- **Lane A (assets/docs):** B1 (after D1) → Q1 → Q2
