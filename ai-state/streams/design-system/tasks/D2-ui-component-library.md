# D2 — UI component library (accessible primitives)

**Stream:** design-system · **Depends on:** D1

## Description

The renderer currently has 4 copies of status badges, 4 error alerts, 5 modal overlays and 7 or more spinners. There are about 40 hand-rolled label+input+error blocks. Modals lack `role="dialog"`, focus traps and Escape, and icon buttons are unlabelled (ui-review #6, #7). Toast timers reset on every parent re-render because the effect depends on `onRemove` (`Toast.tsx:48`), so toasts on the Site Sniper page never dismiss.

This task builds the design-system primitives in `src/renderer/components/ui/` on D1 tokens. Each one is accessible by construction, and tests assert roles, names and behaviour, never class names. It also replaces the legacy LoadingSpinner, ConfirmDialog and Toast at their call sites.

As a keyboard or screen-reader user, I can operate every control, dialog, menu and date picker in WA Stay, so I can plan and book without a mouse.

## Size

L. This is complex UI with about 30 primitives. Deliver it as two commits: (a) form and feedback, (b) overlays and composite. See master-plan DQ1 for the split option.

## Scope

**In scope.** Everything lives in `src/renderer/components/ui/`, one file per component (plus a `*.test.tsx`), with a barrel `index.ts`.

- **Actions:**
  - `Button`: variants `primary` (accent), `secondary` (ink outline), `ghost`, `danger`. Sizes `sm`/`md`/`lg` (32/40/48 px). Props `loading` (spinner, `aria-busy`, disabled, label kept), `leadingIcon`/`trailingIcon`. Polymorphic `as="a"` for links.
  - `IconButton`: requires `label: string`, which becomes `aria-label`. It shows a `Tooltip` with the same text and does not reference it via `aria-describedby`.
- **Form:**
  - `TextField`, `Textarea` and `Select` (native `<select>`).
  - `Checkbox`, `Radio` + `RadioGroup` and `Switch` (a native `input type=checkbox role="switch"`).
  - `Field`, which takes `label`, `hint`, `error`, `required` and `optional` and passes `id`, `aria-describedby` (hint and error ids), `aria-invalid` and `aria-required` to its child control. The error text is preceded by a `CircleAlert` icon.
  - All inputs use `forwardRef` (react-hook-form `register`).
- **Display:**
  - `Card`: `as`, `padding`, and `interactive` (hover elevation, focus ring).
  - `Badge`: tones `neutral|brand|accent|available|warning|danger|sun`.
  - `StatusPill`: icon + label + tone, with an optional `live` pulsing dot that is static under reduced motion. Exports `statusPresets` covering the current watch, snipe and booking status enums in `src/shared/types`.
  - `ProviderBadge`: see Notes.
  - `Spinner`: `role="status"` with a visually hidden `label` (default "Loading"). It has no `fullScreen` prop.
  - `Skeleton`: `aria-hidden` and shimmers.
  - `EmptyState`: icon, Fraunces title, description, actions, optional brush accent.
  - `PageHeader`: one `h1`, description, actions slot, optional back link.
  - `Notice`: inline banner with tones `info|success|warning|danger`. Uses `role="status"`, or `role="alert"` for danger, and can be dismissible.
  - `VisuallyHidden`.
- **Navigation and choice:**
  - `Tabs`: `tablist`/`tab`/`tabpanel`, roving tabindex, ←/→/Home/End, automatic activation, `aria-controls` and `aria-labelledby`.
  - `SegmentedControl`: `radiogroup`/`radio` with arrow keys.
- **Overlays.** All are portalled to `document.body`, set `inert` on `#root` while modal, and lock scroll.
  - `Dialog`: `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, `aria-labelledby` (title), `aria-describedby`. It traps focus with `useFocusTrap`, closes on Esc and overlay click (configurable), returns focus to the opener, and has sizes `sm|md|lg|full`.
  - `ConfirmDialog`: built on `Dialog`. Props `title`, `message`, `confirmLabel`, `tone: 'danger'|'primary'`, `onConfirm` (may return a Promise, which shows loading) and `onCancel`. Initial focus goes to **Cancel** for danger.
  - `Sheet`: a right-side Dialog variant.
  - `Menu`: trigger has `aria-haspopup="menu"` and `aria-expanded`. Items are `menuitem`s, navigated with ↑/↓/Home/End. Enter or Space activates. Esc closes and refocuses the trigger. Supports link items.
  - `Popover`: a non-modal `role="dialog"` anchored to a trigger with `aria-expanded`/`aria-controls`. Focus moves in on open. Esc or outside click closes and returns focus. Positioned by a small `usePosition` hook (below, flips above, clamps to the viewport, recomputes on resize and scroll), with no positioning dependency.
  - `Tooltip`: `role="tooltip"`. Opens on hover after 400 ms and on focus immediately, closes on Esc, blur or leave, and sets `aria-describedby` on its trigger.
- **Feedback:**
  - `ToastProvider` + `useToast()` + `ToastViewport`. The API is `toast.success|info|warning|error(message, { action?, duration? })`, which returns an id, plus `toast.dismiss(id)`.
  - Durations: success and info 5 s, warning 8 s, error persists until dismissed.
  - At most 3 toasts are visible and the rest queue in FIFO order. Each timer starts once per toast id, pauses on hover or focus, and never resets on re-render.
  - Containment: the viewport is `role="region" aria-label="Notifications"`. Each toast is `role="status"`, or `role="alert"` for errors, with a Close `IconButton`.
  - `ToastViewport` renders where it is placed. D3 puts it in the tray. D2 temporarily mounts it in `main.tsx`.
- **Search fields.** Each has `appearance: 'field' | 'segment'`, where `segment` renders inside E1's search pill with a small label above the value.
  - `Combobox`: ARIA 1.2 pattern. The input is `role="combobox"` with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-activedescendant` and `aria-autocomplete="list"`. The listbox holds options, optionally grouped (`role="group"` + label). ↑/↓ move, Enter selects, Esc closes (a second Esc clears), Tab closes. Options come from props (controlled). It shows a "No matches" row.
  - `DateRangeField` + `RangeCalendar`: value `{ arrival?: string; departure?: string }` as `YYYY-MM-DD`, never `Date`. Props `minDate`, `maxDate` and `maxNights`.
    - The Popover shows two months at 640 px or wider and one month below that. Weeks start on Monday.
    - It follows the WAI-ARIA date-picker grid: ←/→ day, ↑/↓ week, PgUp/PgDn month, Home/End week.
    - The first selection sets arrival and the second sets departure. Picking a date on or before arrival restarts the range.
    - The summary reads "Fri 3 Oct – Sun 5 Oct · 2 nights", with Clear and Done buttons.
    - Day cells are named like "Friday 3 October 2026", with ", check-in" or ", check-out" when selected. Disabled days are `aria-disabled`.
    - Date maths uses date-fns on local calendar dates.
  - `GuestsField` + `Stepper`: value `{ adults; children; infants }` with `limits` defaults (adults 1–16, children 0–10, infants 0–5) and hint defaults "18 or over", "6–17", "Under 6". Steppers use `IconButton` labelled "Decrease adults" and "Increase adults", disabled at the limits. The trigger summary reads "2 adults, 1 child" or "Add guests".
- **Hooks:** `useFocusTrap`, `usePosition`, `useAnnounce()` (a polite or assertive live-region announcer, with `AnnouncerProvider`) and `useDisclosure`.
- **Migration:**
  - Delete `components/LoadingSpinner.tsx`, `ConfirmDialog.tsx`, `Toast.tsx` and their tests.
  - Update the call sites in `App.tsx`, `pages/Dashboard.tsx`, `pages/Watches/index.tsx`, `pages/SiteSniper/index.tsx`, `pages/Bookings/BookingsList.tsx` and `pages/Bookings/BookingDetail.tsx`: `Spinner`, `ui/ConfirmDialog`, and the global `useToast()` (remove each page's `<ToastContainer>`). Update `components/index.ts`.
- Add a `/__design` gallery section per component showing every variant and state, and write `docs/design/components.md` (when to use each primitive, with one do/don't each).

**Out of scope:** domain composites such as LocationCard, NightGrid, search pill and filter chips (E1/E2), the app shell (D3), and restyling legacy pages.

## Non-goals

- No new dependencies: no Radix, floating-ui, focus-trap or jest-axe (architecture-notes §10).
- No virtualised list or data-table component.
- `ComingSoonBanner`, `AboutDialog`, `QueueStatus`, `UpdateNotification` and `NotificationBell` are not rebuilt (U5). `ErrorBoundary` is not rebuilt (D3).
- Concessions, equipment and party-size rules are not in `GuestsField`. They are provider-specific and handled in U1/U2 forms.

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] Every component listed in Scope exists in `components/ui/`, is exported from `components/ui/index.ts`, and appears on `#/__design` with all its variants.
- [ ] `Button loading` keeps its label, sets `aria-busy="true"` and is disabled. `Button as="a"` renders a link.
- [ ] `IconButton` fails type-check without `label`.
- [ ] `Field` with an `error` gives its control `aria-invalid="true"` and an `aria-describedby` that includes the error text id. With a `hint`, the hint id is included too.
- [ ] `Dialog`:
  - [ ] Open: focus moves inside, Tab and Shift+Tab cycle within it, and `#root` has `inert`.
  - [ ] Esc closes, and focus returns to the opener.
  - [ ] The title gives it its accessible name.
- [ ] `ConfirmDialog` with `tone="danger"` focuses Cancel first. An async `onConfirm` shows loading until it resolves.
- [ ] `Menu` is fully operable by keyboard (↑/↓/Home/End/Enter/Esc), and the trigger's `aria-expanded` reflects state.
- [ ] `Tabs`: arrow keys move selection and `aria-selected` follows. Only the selected tab is in the tab order.
- [ ] `Toast`:
  - [ ] Timers survive re-renders: a toast shown while the parent re-renders every 1 s still auto-dismisses at 5 s (the regression test for `Toast.tsx:48`).
  - [ ] Error toasts persist until dismissed.
  - [ ] A fourth toast queues until one closes.
- [ ] `DateRangeField` keyboard flow: arrow to a date, Enter, arrow 2 days, Enter. The value becomes `{arrival, departure}` strings, and the summary shows "2 nights". Dates before `minDate` cannot be chosen.
- [ ] `GuestsField`: "Increase adults" increments, and "Decrease adults" is disabled at 1.
- [ ] `Combobox`: typing filters the options, ↓ and Enter select, and `aria-activedescendant` tracks the highlighted option.
- [ ] `ProviderBadge`: the full variant shows monogram and shortName. The compact variant's accessible name is the provider name. An unknown provider shows its id with the name "Unknown provider".
- [ ] The legacy pages compile against the new primitives. `components/LoadingSpinner.tsx`, `ConfirmDialog.tsx` and `Toast.tsx` no longer exist, and `grep -r "ToastContainer" src/renderer` is empty.
- [ ] The token guard (D1) passes for `components/ui/**`, with no raw palette classes, hex or emoji.
- [ ] **Accessibility:**
  - [ ] Every interactive primitive shows the D1 `focus` ring on `:focus-visible`. Checked on `#/__design` by tabbing through the gallery.
  - [ ] Live regions work: toasts are announced (`status`/`alert`), and `useAnnounce('3 results')` updates a polite live region.
  - [ ] Every icon-only control in the gallery has an accessible name. axe on `#/__design` reports 0 critical/serious issues.
  - [ ] Information is never carried by colour alone: StatusPill, Badge tones and Field errors include text or an icon.
- [ ] The 4-check gate passes: `npm run lint` (0 errors), `npm run format:check`, `npm run type-check`, `npm test`.

## Edge Cases

- A Dialog opened from a Menu item returns focus to the Menu trigger, because the item no longer exists.
- Nested overlays: a Popover inside a Dialog closes on Esc without closing the Dialog, and stacked Dialogs handle Esc innermost-first.
- `inert` is removed when the last open modal unmounts, even if it unmounted without closing (route change).
- Popover near the right or bottom edge flips and clamps, with no horizontal page scroll at 960 px width.
- DateRangeField:
  - Month-boundary navigation (31 Oct → 1 Nov).
  - AU DST irrelevance: values are plain calendar dates.
  - Leap day 2028-02-29.
  - `maxNights` exceeded: the departure cell is disabled and the reason is shown in a hint.
  - Clearing resets both values.
- Toast with an identical message fired twice in under 1 s is deduplicated. Dismissing a queued toast before it shows removes it silently.
- `ProviderBadge` brand colour may be any hex: the monogram text uses white or ink-900, whichever has the higher contrast. If neither reaches 4.5:1 (for example `#777777` gives 4.48 and 3.97), use the outlined variant (surface background, brand-colour border, ink text).
- Stepper values arriving from props outside `limits` are clamped, and a dev warning is logged.

## Test Strategy

- **Unit:** about 12 tests. Cover `useFocusTrap` cycling, `usePosition` flip and clamp maths (pure function), the calendar date helpers (month grid, range selection, `maxNights`, `minDate`), the `readableTextOn(hex)` badge contrast picker (including `#777777` falling back to outlined), and `statusPresets` coverage of every status enum value.
- **Component:** about 70 tests across about 28 files, using Testing Library role and name queries plus `user-event`.
  - Keyboard flows for Dialog, Menu, Tabs, SegmentedControl, Combobox, DateRangeField and GuestsField.
  - The Toast timer regression with fake timers and a re-rendering parent.
  - Field ARIA wiring.
  - Button loading.
  - ProviderBadge variants.
  - The existing ConfirmDialog, LoadingSpinner and Toast tests are rewritten against the new components without `toHaveClass` assertions.
- **Integration:** none. Runtime verification on `#/__design`: axe, a keyboard pass through every overlay, and screenshots for the human reviewer.

## Context Files to Read First

- `ai-state/streams/design-system/master-plan.md` and the D1 spec. Read `docs/design/design-language.md` and `src/renderer/styles/tokens.css` once D1 has landed.
- `ai-state/architecture-notes.md`: §3 (`ProviderManifest.brand`, `StayQuery`), §8 renderer conventions.
- `ai-state/research/ui-review.md`: Components, top UX problems #5–#7.
- `src/renderer/components/{Toast,ConfirmDialog,LoadingSpinner}.tsx` and their tests, plus `src/renderer/pages/SiteSniper/index.tsx` (the 1 s re-render that breaks toasts).
- `src/shared/types/` (watch, snipe and booking status enums) and `src/renderer/components/forms/WatchForm.tsx` (react-hook-form usage).
- WAI-ARIA APG patterns: dialog-modal, menu-button, tabs, combobox (list autocomplete), date picker dialog, switch.

## Notes

- **ProviderBadge** props are `{ providerId: string; info?: ProviderBadgeInfo; variant?: 'full'|'compact'; size?: 'sm'|'md' }`.
  - `ProviderBadgeInfo = { id; name; shortName; brand: { color; monogram } }` is structurally assignable from V1's `ProviderManifest`, so D2 does not wait for V1.
  - If `info` is omitted, the badge reads `ProviderManifestsContext`. D2 exports the context and `ProviderManifestsProvider`, and D3 fills it from `useProviders()`. This keeps `ui/` free of `window.api` and React Query.
- `inert` is supported in Electron 28 (Chromium 120). `HTMLElement.inert` does not exist in jsdom, so assert the attribute.
- jsdom lacks `matchMedia`, `ResizeObserver` and layout. Polyfill `matchMedia` in the test file, and test `usePosition` as a pure function that takes rects.
- Popover and Dialog share one overlay stack (`OverlayStackContext`) so Esc ordering and `inert` are handled in one place.
