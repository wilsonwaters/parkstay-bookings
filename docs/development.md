# Development

How to build, run and test WA Stay from source. The code conventions (IPC, migrations,
providers, the pre-commit checks) are in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md); the structure is in the
[architecture overview](architecture/overview.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24** and npm 10 or later (`engines` in `package.json`, `.nvmrc`; CI uses Node 24).
  The app itself runs on Electron 44, which bundles its own Node 24.
- Git.
- What node-gyp needs: `npm ci` runs it over better-sqlite3's `binding.gyp`, and it needs its
  tools even though it compiles nothing ([below](#the-native-module-better-sqlite3)). On
  Windows, the Node.js installer's **Tools for Native Modules** (Python and Visual Studio's C++
  build tools; `install_tools.bat` in the Node.js folder adds them later); on macOS, the Xcode
  Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`); on Linux, Python 3 and `make`.
- Windows, macOS or Linux. Windows is the shipped platform; the Electron smoke tests run on
  Linux under xvfb in CI.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wilsonwaters/wa-stay.git
cd wa-stay
npm ci
```

`npm ci` installs everything, better-sqlite3's prebuilt binary included
([below](#the-native-module-better-sqlite3)). It does not download the Electron binary: since
Electron 42 that happens the first time Electron runs (`npm start`, `npx electron .`, the
Electron tests), or ahead of time with `npx install-electron`.

**The Mapbox token.** Explore's map needs a public Mapbox token at build time:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# then set MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.your-token-here
```

- Use a **public** token (it starts with `pk.`) with public scopes only: it is bundled into the
  app, where anyone can read it. A secret `sk.` token fails the build.
- `.env` is gitignored. Never commit a token or paste one into a file, test or doc.
- Without a token everything works, and Explore shows places as a list.
- CI reads the token from the repository secret (or variable) `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`.

## The native module (better-sqlite3)

better-sqlite3 is native code. Since version 13 the package ships prebuilt **Node-API**
binaries (Windows, macOS and Linux; x64 and arm64), and a Node-API binary loads in any runtime
that supports it: the same file serves Jest on Node 24 and the app on Electron 44. Nothing is
compiled at install, nothing needs rebuilding between running the tests and running the app,
and electron-builder packages the prebuilt binary as it is.

`npm ci` still runs node-gyp for better-sqlite3: installing from the lockfile, npm does not see
the package's `gypfile: false` and runs node-gyp over its `binding.gyp`. That needs Python, and
on Windows Visual Studio's C++ build tools (the Node.js installer's "Tools for Native Modules";
[prerequisites](#prerequisites)), and node-gyp downloads Node's headers. With a prebuilt binary
for the platform it only touches stamp files and compiles nothing.

Nothing rebuilds native modules for Electron any more: there is no `postinstall`
(`electron-builder install-app-deps`), and `electron-builder.json` sets `npmRebuild: false`.
Each would run node-gyp again, against Electron's headers (downloaded for it), to build
nothing, and electron-builder refuses that step when it packages for another platform.
The old `electron-rebuild` dev dependency is gone too: it pinned node-gyp 9, which imports Python's
removed `distutils` and fails on Python 3.12 and later. npm's own node-gyp (10 or later) runs the
install step instead. `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` remains for a broken install.

The Jest scripts check that better-sqlite3 loads first (`scripts/check-native-abi.js`) and say
why it does not instead of failing every database test. A `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch can
only come from a `node_modules` installed before better-sqlite3 13, when it was compiled per
runtime and had to be swapped between a Node build and an Electron build: run `npm ci`. Any
script that swapped those builds is no longer needed.

## Running in development

Two terminals:

```bash
# Terminal 1: TypeScript watch (main), the preload bundle and the Vite dev server on port 3000
npm run dev

# Terminal 2, once Vite prints "ready": Electron, loading http://localhost:3000
npm start
```

Open the app in the Electron window, not in a browser: in a plain browser there is no main
process, and the page says so. In development the window opens its DevTools; the main process
logs to the terminal and to `<userData>/logs`.

The dev server address (`ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL`) and the test hooks (`WA_STAY_*`) are honoured
only when the app runs from source: unpackaged, and not loaded from an asar archive
(`src/main/app/app-source.ts`). A packaged app ignores them, even renamed to `electron`.

Development uses your real data folder (`%APPDATA%\WA Stay`, `~/Library/Application
Support/WA Stay` or `~/.config/WA Stay`). To try something on a throwaway profile, set
`WA_STAY_USER_DATA_DIR` to an empty folder.

## Building and packaging

```bash
npm run build     # empties dist/, then main (tsc + tsc-alias), preload (esbuild), renderer (Vite) into it
npm run dist:win  # build, then the Windows installer and portable exe in release/
npm run pack      # build, then an unpacked app in release/ (quicker to try)
```

Vite 8 prints a warning that the config is unsupported by `configLoader: 'native'`. It is
expected: `vite.config.ts` uses ES module syntax in a CommonJS package, which Vite's default
(bundling) config loader handles. It would need `vite.config.mts` before a Vite release makes the
native loader the default.

The build starts by removing `dist/` (`scripts/clean-dist.js`): tsc and esbuild never delete
what they wrote before, and electron-builder packages `dist/**`, so a module whose source was
deleted would otherwise ship. The preload is bundled by `scripts/build-preload.js` for the
sandboxed window; the build fails if it imports anything but `electron`. The production
Content-Security-Policy is written into `dist/renderer/index.html` at build time. The package
(`electron-builder.json` `files`) leaves out the `.d.ts` and `.map` files tsc and esbuild write
beside the JavaScript: nothing reads them at run time (Node applies source maps to stack traces
only with `--enable-source-maps`, which the app does not use, so the logs carry the compiled
positions either way). The packaged executable's Electron fuses are set at package time
(`electronFuses` in `electron-builder.json`; [security](security.md#the-packaged-app-electron-fuses)).

Of better-sqlite3, the package holds its JavaScript (inside `app.asar`) and one prebuilt
binary, `prebuilds/${platform}-${arch}.node` (in `app.asar.unpacked`); its C sources and the
other platforms' binaries are left out (`files`, `asarUnpack` and `asar.smartUnpack: false` in
`electron-builder.json`). electron-builder expands `${platform}` to the platform of the machine
that builds, so **each OS packages its own target**: build the Windows app on Windows (as CI
does), not on Linux or macOS. Releasing: [release process](release-process.md).

## Testing

### Jest

`jest.config.js` has two projects: **main** (Node: `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`,
`tests/scripts`, `src/main`, `src/shared`) and **renderer** (jsdom: `src/renderer`,
`tests/integration/renderer`). Shared helpers are in `tests/utils/` (fake providers, a fake
`safeStorage`, an IPC harness, the ParkStay fixture server) and recorded data in
`tests/fixtures/`, including SQL dumps of real v5 and v6 databases for the migration tests.
Dependencies that ship only ES modules (htmlparser2, React Router 8) are compiled to CommonJS
for Jest by esbuild (`ESM_ONLY_DEPENDENCIES` in `jest.config.js`).
[tests/README.md](../tests/README.md) has the details.

`npm run test:tz` runs the timestamp tests with the host in Perth (UTC+8), where an unzoned
SQLite timestamp read as local time would be 8 hours out. CI runs it after the unit tests.

The docs have tests too (`tests/unit/docs/`): every relative link and image in the docs
resolves, the provider guide's code blocks match the example providers they come from, those
examples compile and register, and every ParkStay endpoint has a verification status.

### Electron smoke tests

```bash
npm run build:e2e            # no Mapbox token: Explore is list-only, deterministically
xvfb-run -a npm run test:e2e # or just npm run test:e2e with a display
```

Playwright's `_electron` launcher drives the **built** app through 21 journeys in 10 specs
(`tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`): launch, navigation, Explore and its dates, resizing the window, a place
to a watch, creating a watch and a snipe, a held snipe paid from its notification, bookings, the
v1.x upgrade, and a lifecycle walk through every page and Settings section with a relaunch. One
more check is opt-in: with a Mapbox token in the build and `E2E_MAP=1`, resizing the window must
not count as a map move (`explore-resize.spec.ts`). The harness
(`tests/e2e/support/wa-stay.ts`) gives every launch:

- its own temp userData (`WA_STAY_USER_DATA_DIR`), checked before anything else;
- **fixture mode** (`WA_STAY_E2E_FIXTURES_DIR`): providers answer from
  `tests/e2e/fixtures/http/`, and a network guard cancels every other request;
- a production renderer, Perth time, Australian English, and a window forced online
  (`forceOnline`), so the suite passes with no network at all;
- seeding before launch (`support/seed.ts`: a held snipe, a v1.x data folder) and temp folders
  (`tempDir`), removed after the apps close;
- a trace, a screenshot and the main-process log for a failed test.

CI runs it on every push and pull request (`e2e` job) and always uploads the report. Selectors
use roles and accessible names only. More: [tests/README.md](../tests/README.md).

### Other checks

- **Live Electron tests** (`npm run test:electron`, not part of `npm test`):
  `ElectronSessionHttpClient` on a real partition, the ParkStay module through it, and the
  provider sign-in and payment windows, all against loopback servers.
- **The packaged app** (`npx electron-builder --linux dir --publish never`, then
  `xvfb-run -a npm run smoke:packaged`): first reads `app.asar`'s index (the main, preload and
  renderer builds are there, no `.d.ts` or `.map` file under `dist/`, and every packed file has
  an integrity hash) and the executable's Electron fuses
  ([security](security.md#the-packaged-app-electron-fuses)). It then starts the executable as
  shipped (Node's inspector must stay off), and two copies with only the inspector fuse turned
  back on for Playwright: `release/linux-unpacked/wa-stay` and a copy renamed `electron`. Every
  start has every test hook set and a temp `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. It checks that the hooks are
  ignored (userData is the normal `WA Stay` folder under that temp config folder), the page
  comes from `app.asar`, and the app quits with code 0 within 10 s. CI's `packaged-smoke` job.
- **A real browser for browser providers** (opt-in):
  `WA_STAY_BROWSER_E2E=1 npx jest tests/integration/browser-automation.smoke.test.ts`
  ([browser providers](providers/browser-providers.md#the-real-browser-smoke-test)).
- **Documentation screenshots** (`npm run docs:screenshots`): rebuilds the app (with your local
  Mapbox token if `.env` has one), drives it in fixture mode (`tests/docs/`,
  `playwright.docs.config.ts`) and writes optimised PNGs to `docs/images/`. With a token only
  `api.mapbox.com` is reached; without one the run is network-free and Explore is list-only.
  Provider photos are never loaded, so cards show the placeholder. On Linux without a display
  it runs under `xvfb-run`.

**No test touches live provider data that matters.** Tests use recorded fixtures; live checks
are anonymous and read-only, and nothing ever places a real hold, booking or payment
(architecture-notes §12.33).

## Before you commit

```bash
npm run lint          # 0 errors
npm run format:check  # npm run format fixes it
npm run type-check
npm test
```

CI enforces all four, plus `test:tz`, the Electron smoke tests and the packaged smoke check.
Commits follow conventional commits (`feat(watches): …`, `fix(parkstay): …`).

## Common tasks

- **Add an IPC method:** the channel in `src/shared/contracts/channels.ts`, the definition (zod
  request, response type) in the namespace file, a handler with `handle()` in
  `src/main/ipc/handlers/`, the mapper in `src/preload/index.ts`, then a hook in
  `src/renderer/api/`. The parity tests fail until all agree. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).
- **Add a migration:** only in `src/main/database/connection.ts` `runMigrations()`, following
  the rules in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), with an upgrade test from the v5 and v6 fixtures.
- **Add a provider:** [Adding a provider](providers/adding-a-provider.md).
- **Add a setting:** a key in `SETTING_KEYS` (`src/shared/contracts/settings.ts`); main owns its
  type and category.
- **Add a page:** a route in `src/renderer/app/routes.ts` and `AppRoutes.tsx`, the page under
  `src/renderer/features/<domain>/`, built from `components/ui` primitives and design tokens
  ([design](design/components.md)). Data only through `renderer/api/` hooks.

## Debugging

- **Main process:** the terminal and `<userData>/logs/` (`combined.log`, `error.log`). Logs
  never include IPC payload values or secrets.
- **Renderer:** the DevTools the development window opens. React Query's cache holds every
  `window.api` answer.
- **IPC:** a failed call returns `{ success: false, code, error }`; the `code` (`VALIDATION`
  with `issues`, `NOT_FOUND`, `PROVIDER_ERROR`, `ACCESS_GATE`, `RATE_LIMITED`…) says which side
  to look at.
- **Database:** `<userData>/wa-stay.db` (SQLite, WAL). Open a copy with any SQLite browser while
  the app is closed.
- **Providers in tests:** `createTestProviderContext` and the ParkStay fixture server let a
  provider run without the network.

## Troubleshooting

**Port 3000 is already in use.** Vite then moves to another port, but `npm start` still loads
`http://localhost:3000`. Stop whatever holds port 3000 and run `npm run dev` again:

```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /F /PID <PID>

# macOS / Linux
lsof -i :3000
kill <PID>
```

Or point Electron at the port Vite printed:
`npx cross-env ELECTRON_RENDERER_URL=http://localhost:3001 electron .`

**The Electron window is blank.**

1. Vite is not running yet: wait for its "ready" line, then reload (Ctrl+R) or run `npm start`
   again.
2. A TypeScript error stopped the main-process build: fix the error shown in terminal 1.
3. The preload bundle is missing (`dist/preload/index.js`): the window says so. `npm run dev`
   builds it; `npm run build:preload` builds it once.
4. Check the DevTools console and the main-process log.

**"better-sqlite3 is built for the wrong runtime, so the Jest suite cannot load it."** Your
`node_modules` predates better-sqlite3 13 (one binary for Node and Electron): run `npm ci`.

**The app does not start: "NODE_MODULE_VERSION".** The same: run `npm ci`.

**"Cannot find module".** Reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci`.

**Editor shows TypeScript errors the build does not.** Restart the editor's TypeScript server.

**"Database is locked".** Another WA Stay is running on the same data folder. Only one instance
runs per folder; close the other one.
