# WA Stay components

The design-system primitives live in `src/renderer/components/ui/`, one file per component with its test beside it. Import them from the barrel:

```ts
import { Button, Dialog, Field, TextField, useToast } from '../components/ui';
```

Every screen is built from these and the tokens in [design-language.md](design-language.md). If a screen needs something that is not here, add it to `components/ui/` with tests (architecture-notes §12.8); never hand-roll a dialog, menu or date picker inside a feature.

Run `npm run dev` and open `#/__design` to see every primitive with its variants and states, using the real fonts and CSS.

## Rules that apply to all of them

- **Tokens only.** No raw palette classes, hex or emoji in `components/ui` (the token guard test enforces it). Provider brand colours are data and arrive through props.
- **Accessible by construction.** Each primitive sets its own roles, names and keyboard behaviour. Tests query by role and accessible name, never by class name.
- **Focus is always visible.** The D1 `:focus-visible` ring (2 px `focus`) shows on every interactive part. Controls that hide a native input (SegmentedControl, RadioCard) draw the ring on their visible box.
- **Never colour alone.** Status, tone and errors always carry text or an icon as well.
- **Overlays share one stack.** Dialog, Sheet and Popover register with `OverlayStack`: Escape closes only the top one, `#root` and lower overlays are `inert` while a modal is open, and page scroll is locked. Overlays are portalled to `document.body`, outside `#root`.
- **Floating surfaces live outside `#root`.** Anything that must keep working while a modal is open (the tray, which holds the toast viewport) is rendered in a `Portal`, as overlays and the announcer are. Inside `#root` it turns `inert` under a modal: toasts fired from a ConfirmDialog would be silent and unclickable. Toasts must stay above the modal scrim (`z-overlay`) while the tray's `z-tray` is below it, so the tray rises to `z-toast` while a modal is open and sets its other cards aside ([shell.md](shell.md#tray)).
- **App providers.** `ToastProvider`, `AnnouncerProvider` and `ProviderManifestsProvider` (filled from `useProviders()`) wrap the app in `app/AppProviders.tsx`. `ToastViewport` renders where it is placed, at its container's width, which must be outside `#root`: it is the first slot of the tray.

## Actions

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Button` | Any action. `primary` (coral) is the one main action per view, `secondary` an ink outline, `ghost` a quiet action, `danger` a crimson outline: the default destructive style. The only solid danger fill (deep crimson, `danger-fg`) is the final confirm of a destructive `ConfirmDialog`. `floating` (white) and `inverse` (ink) carry the pill shadow, for controls that float over a photo or the map ("Search this area", Explore's "Show map"). `shape="pill"` rounds the ends. `as="a"` for a link that looks like a button. | Label it with a verb: "Create watch", "Hold site". Use `loading` while the action runs: the label stays, and the button stays focusable (`aria-disabled`) but ignores presses. | Put two primary buttons in one view, use `danger` for anything that is not destructive, build your own solid red button, or round a button with a `!rounded-full` class (use `shape="pill"`). |
| `IconButton` | An action shown only as an icon: close, more actions, previous month. Takes the Button variants and `shape="pill"` (a circle, e.g. the search pill's Search, a close button on a photo). | Give a `label` that says what happens ("Delete watch"); it becomes the name and the tooltip. | Use it when there is room for a text Button; icon-only is for repeated or universally understood actions. |
| `Chip` | A filter in a row of filters: either it opens choices (a `Popover` trigger, `selected` while any is chosen, named for what is chosen: "Region, 1 selected"), or it is an on/off toggle (`pressed`: `aria-pressed`, a tick while on). Ink outline while off, the brand tint while on. | Keep the label to the filter's name; show a count ("Region · 1") rather than the choices. | Use it for an action (that is a Button), or build chips by hand in a feature. |

## Form

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Field` | The label, hint and error around one control. It wires `id`, `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid` and `aria-required` onto the control. | Pass the validation message as `error` (react-hook-form `errors.x?.message`). Mark the few optional fields with `optional`. | Write your own `<label>` and error `<p>` next to an input. |
| `TextField` | Single-line text, numbers, email. | Use `leadingIcon` for a search field. Use `{...register('name')}`: it forwards refs. | Use `placeholder` as the label. |
| `Textarea` | Multi-line notes. | Say in the hint what the text is for. | Use it for one-line values. |
| `Select` | Choosing from a short, fixed list (up to about 7 options). | Keep option labels short and sentence case. | Use it for long or searchable lists; use `Combobox`. |
| `Checkbox` | Independent yes/no choices in a form that is saved later. | Add a `description` when the consequence is not obvious. | Use it for a setting that applies at once; use `Switch`. |
| `Radio` + `RadioGroup` | One choice from a few, with the options visible. | Give the group a `legend` that asks the question. | Use radios for a single on/off choice. |
| `Switch` | A setting that takes effect immediately (desktop notifications). | Label it with the setting, not with "On/Off". | Put it in a form that needs a Save button; use `Checkbox`. |

## Display

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Card` | A surface resting on the page: a location, a watch, a settings group. | Render an interactive card `as="a"` or `as="button"` with `interactive`, so it is focusable. | Put a card inside a card, or a card inside a dialog (shadow on shadow). |
| `Badge` | Short static labels: counts, "Soon", categories. | Pick the tone by meaning (`available`, `warning`, `sun` for time cues). | Use a badge as a button, or rely on its colour to carry the meaning. |
| `StatusPill` + `statusPresets` | The status of a watch, snipe or booking. | Spread the preset: `<StatusPill {...statusPresets.snipe[snipe.status]} />`. Add a preset when an enum grows (the test fails until you do). | Invent a one-off status colour in a feature. |
| `ProviderBadge` | Showing whose system something belongs to, on every watch, snipe, booking, notification and location. | Pass only `providerId` inside `ProviderManifestsProvider`; use `compact` in dense rows. | Draw a provider's logo, or hard-code its colour. |
| `Spinner` | A wait longer than about 300 ms with no known shape. | Give a `label` that says what is loading ("Loading watches"). | Show it for quick actions, or full screen; lay it out with the parent. |
| `Skeleton` | Loading content whose shape you know (cards, rows). `shape="fill"` has no corners of its own, for a frame that clips it (a photo). | Match the size of the real content so nothing jumps. | Use it without a status or `aria-busy` on the region: it is hidden from assistive technology. |
| `EmptyState` | Nothing to show yet, and the next step. | Offer one action ("Create watch") and say plainly what will happen. Under a page `h1`, use `size="md"` (a Figtree section title) so it never outranks the page title; the default display title is for an empty state that is the whole view, and `headingLevel={1}` makes it the page's `h1` ("This place isn't available"). | Use more than one brushstroke accent in a region, or jokes. |
| `PageHeader` | The top of every page: its one `h1`, a line of description, actions, and optionally `media`, a picture that leads the title (beside it from `sm`, above it when narrow), such as a watch's place photo. | Put the page's primary action in `actions`; size the `media` yourself (`aspect-[4/3] w-44 rounded-lg`). | Add a second `h1` anywhere on the page. |
| `Notice` | An inline message about the page or section: info, success, warning, danger. `icon` replaces the tone's icon when another says it better (`Clock` for a place's booking rules, in `info`, and for a release time that blocks a stay, in the sun-toned `warning`). | Say what happened and what to do next, with an action if there is one. | Use it for a passing confirmation; use a toast. |
| `VisuallyHidden` | Text only screen readers need, such as ", coming soon" after a nav label. | Use it to complete a name that the visual design shortens. | Hide information sighted people also need. |
| `Brushstroke`, `PhotoPlaceholder` | The D1 atoms. See design-language.md. | Follow the brushstroke placement rules. | Use them as decoration elsewhere. |

## Navigation and choice

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Tabs`, `TabList`, `Tab`, `TabPanel` | Switching between sections of one thing (a location's overview, sites, rules). With no `value` or `defaultValue`, the first enabled tab is selected. | Name the `TabList` and keep tab labels to one or two words. | Use tabs for steps in a flow or for navigation between pages. |
| `SegmentedControl` | Two to four views of the same content (Map / List). | Keep the options parallel and short. | Use it for settings or for more than four options. |
| `RadioCard` + `RadioCardGroup` | A prominent choice with descriptions, such as the provider step of a create flow. | Put a `ProviderBadge` or "Soon" badge in `trailing`, and disable cards that cannot be chosen yet. | Put links or buttons inside a card; the whole card is the radio. |
| `Disclosure` | Optional detail that most people skip: advanced options, an explanation. | Write the `summary` as what is hidden ("Advanced options"). | Hide required fields or errors in it. |

## Overlays

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Dialog` | A focused task or decision that blocks the page: editing a watch, a sign-in prompt. | Give it a `title` (its name) and put actions in `footer`. Let Escape and the overlay close it unless data would be lost. | Open a dialog on page load, or for information a `Notice` could show. |
| `ConfirmDialog` | Confirming a destructive or costly action. | Use `tone="danger"` for deletes (Cancel gets focus) and return the Promise from `onConfirm` so it shows loading. If it rejects, the dialog stays open and shows the error's message as an alert. | Ask "Are you sure?" for actions that can be undone; offer Undo in a toast instead. |
| `Sheet` | Long forms, filters or details beside the page, from the right. | Keep the primary action in the footer so it stays visible. | Use it for a quick yes/no; use `ConfirmDialog`. |
| `Menu` + `MenuItem` | A short list of actions on one thing (rename, pause, delete). | Use `href` for items that navigate and `tone="danger"` for destructive ones; group with `MenuSeparator`. | Put form controls in a menu, or use it for site navigation. |
| `Popover` | Small, non-blocking panels anchored to a button: filters, the date and guest pickers. `padding="none"` for content with its own sections (a list above a Clear/Done footer). | Return focus with the `close` render prop from a Done button. | Put a whole form or a second popover inside one. |
| `Tooltip` | A short hint on hover or focus for a control that already has a name. It stays open while the pointer is on it (WCAG 1.4.13). | Keep it to a few words; it describes the control. | Put essential information or interactive content in a tooltip. |
| `Portal` | Rendering a floating surface at the end of `document.body`, outside `#root`: the toast viewport, the tray. | Wrap any app-level layer that must stay usable while a modal is open. | Portal page content, or overlays (Dialog, Popover and Menu already portal themselves). |

## Feedback

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `useToast` (`ToastProvider`, `ToastViewport`) | Brief confirmation of something the person just did ("Watch saved"), or an error from it. Toasts are added to a polite live region that is always rendered; errors are `role="alert"`. | Use `toast.error` for failures; it stays until dismissed. Add an `action` for Undo. Mount `ToastViewport` in a `Portal`. | Use a toast for something the person must act on later; use a notification or a `Notice`. |
| `useAnnounce` (`AnnouncerProvider`) | Telling screen-reader users about a change they cannot see: "24 results", "Map updated". | Announce once the change has happened, politely unless it is urgent. | Announce every keystroke, or repeat what a toast or live output already says. |

## Search fields

All three take `appearance="field"` (forms) or `"segment"` (a segment of E1's search pill, with a small label above the value). In a segment there is no room for a hint line, so the `hint` is read by screen readers only; an `error` still marks the control invalid and shows under the value with its icon.

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Combobox` | Choosing one option from a long list by typing: campgrounds, places. | Pass `options` (optionally with `group`), and `filter={false}` with `onInputChange` when you filter or search yourself. | Use it for free text that need not match an option. |
| `DateRangeField` + `RangeCalendar` | Check-in and check-out dates. | Pass `minDate`, `maxDate` and `maxNights` from the provider's rules; values are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings. | Convert the values to `Date` or timestamps; time zones would shift days. |
| `Stepper` | A small whole number: vehicles, nights, guests of one age. An `error` shows under it, joins its description and marks it `aria-invalid`, and the group can take focus, so a flow can move focus to it. | Set `min` and `max` from the real limits and give a `hint` for the rule. | Use it for numbers people type faster than they click (postcodes, prices); use `TextField`. |
| `GuestsField` | Who is coming: adults, children, infants. | Override `limits` when a provider allows fewer people. | Add provider rules (concessions, equipment) here; they are provider stay fields (U1/U2). |

## Hooks

| Hook | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `useFocusTrap(ref, { active })` | Keeping Tab inside a custom modal surface and returning focus on close. It skips hidden, invisible and disabled controls (including a disabled `<fieldset>`), and a Tab after focus fell to the body comes back in. Dialog and Sheet already use it. |
| `usePosition(anchorRef, floatingRef, { open })` | Placing a floating layer below or above its anchor, flipped and clamped to the window. Built on the pure `computePosition`. |
| `useDisclosure()` | The state and ARIA props for a custom show/hide pattern. `Disclosure` uses it. |
| `useOverlay()` / `OverlayStack` | Registering a new kind of overlay so Escape order and `inert` stay correct. |
| `useNow(intervalMs = 60_000)` (`hooks/useNow`) | The current time for relative times and countdowns. Every component asking for the same interval shares one timer (`useSyncExternalStore`), which stops when the last one unmounts: a list of 50 watches re-renders once a minute, not 50 times. Use a minute for "12 min ago" and a second only for a live countdown. |
| `useAccountStatus(providerId)` (`api/accounts`) | The person's account with a provider as main last recorded it (`accounts.list()`, no request to the provider), or `undefined` while loading and for a provider without sign-in. Refreshed on `account:updated`. A watch's automatic hold uses it: "connect ParkStay in Settings" when the account is optional, and a notice when the provider requires one for holds. |

## Domain components

Shared pieces built from the primitives, in `src/renderer/components/` (outside `ui/`, because they know about locations and routes).

| Component | Use it for | Do | Don't |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LocationCard` | A place to stay in a list (Explore's results, and later watches and detail pages). One link to `ROUTES.placeDetail`, named by the place's name; photo, area (up to two lines, so the region is never cut off), provider, kind, up to 3 facility icons, "Book online" or "Info only", unit count. Hovered (here or on its pin) it lifts onto a white surface with the pop shadow; selected it also gets a 1 px brand outline and `aria-current`, quieter than the 2 px focus ring so the two never look alike. | Pass `highlighted` and `selected` (Explore keeps them in step with the map), `stay` and `linkState` for the detail link (Explore's dates and guests, and `{ from: 'explore', search }`, both memoised), and `children` for extra state such as availability (E3). | Put buttons or other links inside it; the whole card is one link. |
| `LocationPhoto` | A location's first photo, hot-linked from the provider: lazy, no referrer, `https:` only (`photoUrl`; main already drops other schemes, this is the renderer's own check), a skeleton while loading, `PhotoPlaceholder` ("No photo available for {name}") when missing, broken or not https. `alt` is `''` by default, for a photo beside the place's own name; pass the name where the photo stands for the place (a watch card, a watch's header). `kind` is optional (a watch keeps none; the placeholder then shows a map pin). | Size and round it from the parent (`aspect-[4/3] rounded-lg`). Take the URLs from the catalogue (`useCatalogAll` for a list, one search of main's local catalogue; `useLocationDetail` for one place). | Put text or overlays on the photo. |
| `amenityIcon(name)` | The lucide icon for a facility, matched by meaning from the provider's own words; `MapPin` when unknown (design-language.md, "Amenities"). | Pair the icon with the facility's name for screen readers. | Show the icon as the only signal. |
| `NightGrid` | One stay's availability, unit by night: a place's "Check availability" results (E2), and a watch's last check (U1). Takes `UnitAvailability[]` as a provider returns them, the stay's `arrival` and `departure`, and optionally `unitNoun` (`unitNoun(kind)`: sites, cabins), `currency` (the manifest's), `source` (the provider's short name) and `caption`. It shows a summary line ("8 of 24 sites free for all 2 nights"; pass `summaryRef` to move focus there after a check) that counts only units whose known nights settle the stay: a night not released yet, or one the source did not report, is never read as taken. With nothing settled it says why ("These nights aren't released for booking yet", "ParkStay didn't say which nights are free; check on ParkStay"), and short notes count the units it leaves out. Then a "Fully available only" switch (on, unless `fullyAvailableOnly={false}`: a watch that found only some nights starts with it off; a new value, such as a later result's, resets the switch to it), a key to the icons, and a real `<table>`: a caption, a column per night ("Fri 3", with the month on the first night and on the 1st; never the check-out day), a row header per unit, and in each cell an icon, the price when known, and the state in words (visually hidden "Available, $30", "Booked", "Closed", "Not released yet", "Unknown"). The first 10 rows show, then "Show all {n} sites". The table sits in a named region that scrolls sideways with the unit names held in place, so a 30-night stay is still one row per unit; the region is `relative`, so the cells' visually hidden words scroll with it and never widen the page, and it is a tab stop only while it overflows. | Put a release notice or a "Results for 6–8 Nov" marker in `children`, above the summary. Keep its wording domain-generic: it never says "watch" or "place". | Show a grid without saying which dates it is for once the dates on the page have changed, or colour a cell without its icon and words. |
| `StepFlow` | A create flow, one step at a time (U1's New watch; U2 and U3 reuse it). Controlled: `steps`, `current`, `onStepChange`, `onContinue` (resolve `false` to stay), `finalLabel`. An ordered step list (finished steps are buttons back to them, the current one `aria-current="step"`), the step's `h2` ("Step 3 of 5: Your stay" for screen readers), then Back and Continue. A step change focuses its heading; a step that fails its check focuses its first `aria-invalid` field. | Keep the form in the caller and check one step's fields on Continue. | Put steps in the URL, or use it for tabs. |
| `ProviderPicker` | The provider step of a create flow: a `RadioCardGroup` of the providers with a capability, each with its name, description and `ProviderBadge`. One qualifying provider is chosen for you and still shown (§12.9). | Pass the flow's capability (`watches`, `snipes`) and an `emptyMessage` for when none qualify. | Hide the step when only one provider qualifies. |
| `LocationCombobox` | Choosing one provider's place by name: the D2 `Combobox` over `useLocationSearch` (main's full-text search, from 2 letters, after 250 ms), options "Name" with the area under it. It announces how many matched, shows Retry when the search fails, and says when the provider's catalogue is still loading. | Pass the chosen provider; store the `LocationChoice` it gives. | Search every provider at once; that is Explore's "Where". |
| `ProviderStayFields` | A provider's own stay inputs from its manifest (`stayFields`, §12.1): select, number (Stepper), text, yes/no. `stayFieldsFor(manifest, uses)` picks them by `appliesTo`; `stayFieldIssue` checks them with main's rules (`shared/utils/stay-fields`). | Show the `watch` (or `snipe`) fields with the stay, and the `hold` fields when a hold may be placed. | Name a provider or one of its fields in a feature. |
| `UnitPicker` | Optional unit preferences from `catalog.get(key).units`, in a Disclosure: grouped by unit type with an "All {type}" box, or listed as they are when each type has one unit (unit classes). Nothing chosen means any unit; chosen units the place no longer lists are kept until unticked. The heading defaults to "Preferred {sites}" (`label`); the caller says what choosing none means in `hint` ("Leave all unticked to be told about any site."). | Store `unitIds`; match older names as well as ids. Pass the flow's own `hint`. | Require a choice, or put one flow's wording in the picker. |
| `stayFormat` (`components/stay/stayFormat`) | How a stay reads (pure): `stayDatesLabel(arrival, departure, today)` "Fri 12 – Sun 14 Dec" (the year only when the stay is not all in `today`'s year), `stayNightsLabel` "2 nights", `partyLabel` "2 adults, 1 child" (concessions count; "No guests" when nobody is set). Calendar dates stay `YYYY-MM-DD` strings until formatted, so no time zone shifts them. | Use it for a watch's, snipe's or booking's stay. Pass the provider's today. | Use it where E2's shorter `stayRangeLabel` ("12–14 Dec") fits, such as NightGrid's marker. |
| `timeFormat` (`components/timeFormat`) | How an instant reads (pure): `relativeTime(date, now)` "just now", "12 min ago", "3 h ago", "yesterday", then "Fri 3 Oct"; `timeInZone(date, zone, now)` "3:15 pm AWST", with the day on another day ("Fri 3 Oct, 3:15 pm AWST"); `dayInZone(date, zone)` "Fri 3 Oct". | Show times in the provider's zone (`manifest.timezone`), where the place is; pass `useNow()` as `now`. | Show a time without its zone, or in the computer's zone when the place is elsewhere. |
| `ExternalLink` | Any link that leaves WA Stay for the provider's site or another website. `target="_blank"` with no referrer, which the app window hands to the system browser; a trailing `ExternalLink` icon, and "(opens in your browser)" for screen readers. A text link by default, with an optional quieter `detail` line under the label (the host); `variant` (and `size`, `fullWidth`) make it look like a Button ("Book on ParkStay"). | Name where it goes: "View on ParkStay", "More information" with the host after it. | Use it for in-app routes (use a router `Link`), or open a URL from a click handler instead. |
| `RichText` | A provider's description: HTML main has already sanitised (`sanitizeProviderHtml`, which also gives every https link `target="_blank"`, nests the provider's headings from `h3` under the page's `h2` sections, and leaves out the place's own photos), with scoped styles for paragraphs, lists, links, strong and em. | Pass only `LocationDetail.descriptionHtml` or other HTML main sanitised. | Sanitise or rewrite HTML in the renderer, or pass HTML from anywhere else. |
| `Countdown` | The time left until an instant: a hold, a queue session, a release (U2 builds its timeline on it). `to` (ISO string or Date) and `format`: `clock` ("4h 05m", "23:10", "now") or `minutes` ("12 min"). It is a `role="timer"`, never a live region and never negative; every countdown re-renders from one shared one-second ticker (`hooks/useNow`), and only the countdown itself re-renders. | Write the words around it ("· 12 min left"), and announce a change that matters yourself, once. | Make it a live region, or tick a whole page for it. |
| `AboutPanel` (`features/settings/about/`) | The About content, with no heading of its own: the version (`app.getInfo`), what WA Stay is, the runtime versions, GitHub and Report an issue (`ExternalLink`), Open logs folder and the licence. The account menu's `AboutDialog` wraps it under the B1 lockup; Settings → About renders it under its section heading. Props: `actions?` (more actions at the end of the links row, such as Check for updates) and `children?` (more content under that row, such as the check's result). | Add what one place needs through `actions` and `children`, so both stay one source. | Copy its content into another screen, or give it a heading (each host has its own). |

### Explore's default order

When the search has no text, Explore orders the list itself (`features/explore/results/order.ts`); a text search keeps the catalogue's relevance order (best match first), since that is what the person asked for.

- **With the map:** nearest the middle of the map area first, or, before the person moves the map, nearest the middle of the results it frames. The list then reads from the centre of what the map shows outwards, so the first cards are the pins in the middle of the map, and panning ("Search as I move the map") brings the nearest places to the top. All of WA opens on the middle of the state (Lake Mason, Karijini) rather than on "14 Mile" and "3 Mile Camp", which only sort first.
- **Without a map** (list-only): by name, A to Z, ignoring case and accents, with names that start with a number ("3 Mile Camp", "14 Mile") last, in numeric order. Alphabetical by name is what people scan a long list by; the number-led names are ParkStay's distance markers, which mean nothing at the top of a list.
- **Why not by region:** the region filter and the map already group places by region, and a grouped list would need headings the map view could not keep in step with.
- **Deterministic:** distance on a flat projection scaled by latitude (right for ordering within WA); ties by name, then by key; places with no position last. The tests rely on it.
